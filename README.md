# CSV-Files
In this project I worked with CSV files, how to create code to use them, how to do operations on them. 
I managed to write methods to get information from a CSV file or multiple files like excel files, google sheets or any other app or link like them. 
It's easy to extract a piece of information from a sheet that has 20 or 30 items but it is impossible and a waste of time to try to do the same thing with a sheet that has maybe thousand or even million of items. So this project introduced how to create a code to do this task for you just by a press of button and in seconds. 
You can work on as many as items and files as you want and it will still work properly and extract the information you want for you. 
And here I worked with some examples of extracting information on a single file and multiple files with database prepared for this project and then you can work with any database you want. 
This project is divided into two codes. First: maxCSV: that works on data folder that has a folder for each year. 
Second: Which countries export: that works on a CSV file that has information on the export products of countries.
